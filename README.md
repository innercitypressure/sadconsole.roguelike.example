# Introduction
Template SadConsole v9.2 Based Roguelike, entirely inspired by the excellent work of [Sofistico on MagiRogue](https://github.com/Sofistico/MagiRogue).  This is only a base roguelike example based on his code that you can build whatever you want on.  He did all the hardwork, I just stripped it to barebones for templating.  The only reason I did this was because the documentation for SadConsole 9.2 is still a work in progress and the tutorials I could find were all in 8.x which I had a rough time getting to work.  Remember to credit [Sofistico!](https://github.com/Sofistico/MagiRogue).
